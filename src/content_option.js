    facttwo: "Traditional film distribution companies acquire a film, market it, and then decide how to exhibit it most profitably. Irreversible DAO will translate this process for the emergent crypto space.",
    factthree: "The DAO will negotiate and acquire the rights to exhibit experimental films using crypto-tokens and token-gated movie theaters. Ownership and operations aim to be as transparent and on-chain as possible.",
    factfour: "Motivation: validating the business model of token-ticketed exhibition within the crypto space—even on the smallest of scales—will help to nurture and grow a sustainable, original, independent film ecosystem on the decentralized web. It's how Janus Films came about in the 50s..",
